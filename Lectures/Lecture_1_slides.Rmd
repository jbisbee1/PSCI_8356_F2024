# Why are you here?

--

- I.e., why are you getting a PhD in political science? 

--

  - You enjoy asking and answering questions about **politics**
  
--

  - What questions are you interested in?

---

# How I can help

--

- Quantitative analysis is one of many tools to answer your questions

--

  - Based on **numerical** measurements
  
  - Interested in developing and testing **generalizable** theories
  
  - Measurements and analyses that are easily **replicable** by others
  
--

- Contrast to other two dominant paradigms in political science research

--

  1. Qualitative analyses
  
  2. Formal modeling
  
--

- Never **ever** fall into the petty trap that quantitative is somehow "better"

--

  - â€œA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines."
  
--

- You are here because you do not have a little mind
  
  


---

# Quantitative Analysis

- Political scientists work with quantitative data for three reasons:

--

  1. What can we say about the data **we have**?
  
--

  2. What can we say about the data **we don't have**?
  
--

  3. What can we say about the data **we'd expect to see**?
  
--

- Answering these questions requires three types of statistics

--

  1. Descriptive
  
--

  2. Inferential (from samples to populations)
  
--

  3. Prediction (from models to hypotheticals)
  
--

- All three of these approaches rely on **a test statistic**

--

  - A number that **summarizes data**

---

# Background

- Handout work

---

# Variables 101

- We study **units**

--

  - Phenomena about which we wish to make statements
  
--

  - AKA **cases**: people, counties, nations, dyads, etc.
  
--

- Units have **attributes**

--

  - Characteristics of a **unit** that distinguish it from other units
  
--

- **Variables** are *logical* groupings of *mutually exclusive* attributes

--

  - An important part of quantitative research is assigning a **value** to each attribute
  
--

  - The variable **GDP per capita** takes on the value **$2,256** for the unit **India**
  
  - The variable **year** takes on the value **first** for the unit **you**
  
--

- In quantitative analysis, we assign **scores** to each **value**

---

# Levels of measurement

- Variables can be measured at four levels

--

  1. **Nominal**: cannot be ordered in any logical way
  
  2. **Ordinal**: can be ordered, but no meaning to differences
  
  3. **Interval**: ordinal variables whose differences can be compared
  
  4. **Ratio**: zero is meaningful -- *nothing* of the quantity measured
  
--

- Mathematical operations can be conducted on these levels 

--

  1. **Nominal**: equality ( $=$ ) only (do these take on the same value or not?)
  
  2. **Ordinal**: equality, greater than ( $>$ ) or less than ( $<$ )
  
  3. **Interval**: addition ( $+$ ), subtraction ( $-$ ), averages ( $\frac{1}{n} \sum_i x_i$ )
  
  4. **Ratio**: multiplication ( $*$ ) and division ( $/$ )
  
---

# Tricky cases:

--

  - Celsius? Latitude and longitude? Binary variables?
  
---

# Data structures

- **Data table** (or **data frame**)

--

  - Rows are **units**
  
  - Columns are **variables**
  
  - Cells are **scores**
  
--

- **List**: Tree-like structure

--
  
  - Units are **outermost node**
  
  - Attributes are **child nodes**
  
  - Scores are **children of attributes**
  
--

- We will only use **data table** / **data frames** this semester

--

- But if you want to communicate with CS / engineers / data scientists, **lists** are their world!
