# Why are you here?

--

- I.e., why are you getting a PhD in political science? 

--

  - You enjoy asking and answering questions about **politics**
  
--

  - What questions are you interested in?

---

# How I can help

--

- Quantitative analysis is one of many tools to answer your questions

--

  - Based on **numerical** measurements
  
  - Interested in developing and testing **generalizable** theories
  
  - Measurements and analyses that are easily **replicable** by others
  
--

- Contrast to other two dominant paradigms in political science research

--

  1. Qualitative analyses
  
  2. Formal modeling
  
--

- Never **ever** fall into the petty trap that quantitative is somehow "better"

--

  - â€œA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines."
  
--

- You are here because you do not have a little mind
  
  


---

# Quantitative Analysis

- Political scientists work with quantitative data for three reasons:

--

  1. What can we say about the data **we have**?
  
--

  2. What can we say about the data **we don't have**?
  
--

  3. What can we say about the data **we'd expect to see**?
  
--

- Answering these questions requires three types of statistics

--

  1. Descriptive
  
--

  2. Inferential (from samples to populations)
  
--

  3. Prediction (from models to hypotheticals)
  
--

- All three of these approaches rely on **a test statistic**

--

  - A number that **summarizes data**

---

# Background

- Handout work

---

# Variables 101

- We study **units**

--

  - Phenomena about which we wish to make statements
  
--

  - AKA **cases**: people, counties, nations, dyads, etc.
  
--

- Units have **attributes**

--

  - Characteristics of a **unit** that distinguish it from other units
  
--

- **Variables** are *logical* groupings of *mutually exclusive* attributes

--

  - An important part of quantitative research is assigning a **value** to each attribute
  
--

  - The variable **GDP per capita** takes on the value **$2,256** for the unit **India**
  
  - The variable **year** takes on the value **first** for the unit **you**
  
--

- In quantitative analysis, we assign **scores** to each **value**

---

# Levels of measurement

- Variables can be measured at four levels

--

  1. **Nominal**: cannot be ordered in any logical way
  
  2. **Ordinal**: can be ordered, but no meaning to differences
  
  3. **Interval**: ordinal variables whose differences can be compared
  
  4. **Ratio**: zero is meaningful -- *nothing* of the quantity measured
  
--

- Mathematical operations can be conducted on these levels 

--

  1. **Nominal**: equality ( $=$ ) only (do these take on the same value or not?)
  
  2. **Ordinal**: equality, greater than ( $>$ ) or less than ( $<$ )
  
  3. **Interval**: addition ( $+$ ), subtraction ( $-$ ), averages ( $\frac{1}{n} \sum_i x_i$ )
  
  4. **Ratio**: multiplication ( $*$ ) and division ( $/$ )
  
---

# Tricky cases:

--

  - Celsius? Latitude and longitude? Binary variables?
  
---

# Data structures

- **Data table** (or **data frame**)

--

  - Rows are **units**
  
  - Columns are **variables**
  
  - Cells are **scores**
  
--

- **List**: Tree-like structure

--
  
  - Units are **outermost node**
  
  - Attributes are **child nodes**
  
  - Scores are **children of attributes**
  
--

- We will only use **data table** / **data frames** this semester

--

- But if you want to communicate with CS / engineers / data scientists, **lists** are their world!

---

# Summarizing data: displays

```{r,echo=F}
set.seed(1234)
data.frame(id = paste0(sample(LETTERS,6),sample(LETTERS,6)),
           state = sample(state.abb,6),
           age = round(runif(6,min = 23,max = 30)),
           GPA = round(rnorm(6,mean = 3.9,sd = .1),2))
```

--

- Why not just present this table as is?

--

```{r,echo=F}
set.seed(1234)
data.frame(id = paste0(sample(LETTERS,26),sample(LETTERS,26)),
           state = sample(state.abb,26),
           age = round(runif(26,min = 23,max = 30)),
           GPA = round(rnorm(26,mean = 3.9,sd = .1),2))
```

---

# Summarizing data: displays

- Fundamental tension in quantitative analysis: **detail versus parsimony**

--

- Use a frequency table?

```{r,echo=F}
set.seed(1234)
data.frame(id = paste0(sample(LETTERS,26),sample(LETTERS,26)),
           state = sample(state.abb,26),
           age = round(runif(26,min = 23,max = 30)),
           GPA = round(rnorm(26,mean = 3.9,sd = .1),2)) %>%
  count(age) %>%
  arrange(n)
```

---

# Summarizing data: displays

- What about for GPA?

--

```{r,echo=F}
set.seed(1234)
data.frame(id = paste0(sample(LETTERS,26),sample(LETTERS,26)),
           state = sample(state.abb,26),
           age = round(runif(26,min = 23,max = 30)),
           GPA = round(rnorm(26,mean = 3.9,sd = .1),4)) %>%
  # mutate(GPA = factor(ifelse(GPA < 3.8,'<3.8',
  #                     ifelse(GPA < 3.9,'3.8-3.9',
  #                            ifelse(GPA < 4,'3.9-4','>4.0'))),
  #                     levels = c('<3.8','3.8-3.9','3.9-4','>4.0'))) %>%
  count(GPA)
```

---

# Summarizing data: displays

- **Recode** data into categories, then use a frequency table

--

```{r,echo=F}
set.seed(1234)
data.frame(id = paste0(sample(LETTERS,26),sample(LETTERS,26)),
           state = sample(state.abb,26),
           age = round(runif(26,min = 23,max = 30)),
           GPA = round(rnorm(26,mean = 3.9,sd = .1),2)) %>%
  mutate(GPA = factor(ifelse(GPA < 3.8,'<3.8',
                      ifelse(GPA < 3.9,'3.8-3.9',
                             ifelse(GPA < 4,'3.9-4','>4.0'))),
                      levels = c('<3.8','3.8-3.9','3.9-4','>4.0'))) %>%
  count(GPA)
```

---

# Summarizing data: displays

- Also can visualize with a **plot**

```{r,echo=F}
set.seed(1234)
data.frame(id = paste0(sample(LETTERS,26),sample(LETTERS,26)),
           state = sample(state.abb,26),
           age = round(runif(26,min = 23,max = 30)),
           GPA = round(rnorm(26,mean = 3.9,sd = .1),2)) %>%
  mutate(GPA = factor(ifelse(GPA < 3.8,'<3.8',
                      ifelse(GPA < 3.9,'3.8-3.9',
                             ifelse(GPA < 4,'3.9-4','>4.0'))),
                      levels = c('<3.8','3.8-3.9','3.9-4','>4.0'))) %>%
  count(GPA) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = GPA,y = n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

# Summarizing data: central tendency

- **Central Tendency**: The *typical value*

--

  - **Mode**: most frequently observed value (which levels of measurement (LOM)?)
  
  - **Median**: value of smallest observation for which the cumulative percentage is $\geq$ 50 (which LOM?)
  
  - **Mean**: average $\bar{y} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N y_i$ (which LOM?)
  
---

# Summarizing data: dispersion

- **Dispersion**: The *spread*

--

  - **Range**: difference between smallest and largest values (LOM?)
  
  - **IQR**: difference between 75th%ile and 25%ile (LOM?)
  
  - **Variance**: $s^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N (y_i - \bar{y})^2$ (LOM?)
  
---

# Summarizing data: qualitative description

- Frequency distribution may be "symmetric" or "skewed"

--

  - Median is typically better than mean if data is skewed
  
- May be "unimodal" or "bimodal"

--

- Qualitative descriptions can be quantified

--

  - I.e., skew $g_1 = \frac{1}{N*s^3} \sum_{i = 1}^N (y_i - \bar{y})^3$
  
  - If $g_1 = 0$, symmetric
  
  - If $g_1 < 0$, skewed left
  
  - If $g_1 > 0$, skewed right
